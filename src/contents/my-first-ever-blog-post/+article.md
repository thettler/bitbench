## Hello and welcome to my blog, nice that you found your way here.

### About me

I'm Tobi, a 25-year-old web developer from Munich. For more than 7 years now I have worked in various companies, from large corporations to small agencies, and have learned a lot in the process. At the beginning of this year I took the somewhat scary step of becoming self-employed, to work more with the technologies I enjoy and to create and contribute to more open source projects.

### The Blog

I also want to share the things I've learned, and will learn, over the years with others, which is why I've started this blog.It's still relatively empty here, so I thought I'd share what I've planned and what you can look forward to:

I'm going to write about best practices, tips, how to dos and also my opinion on coding topics.

*The topics will be:*
- PHP
- Laravel 
- Javascript 
- Typescript 
- Vue 
- And much more all around WebDevelopment...

*In fact, two are already planned:*
- How to set up your M1 Mac for PHP development
- How to set up Laravel with static analysis, DDD and other Quality of Life tools.

### The Website

Also, I'm far from finished with this website. At this point it's pretty much just the MVP so i can get started with writing. But there are a lot of things to come and look forward to. Some planed features and improvements are:

- Comments on posts and bits
- A list of my OpenSource packages + documentation
- A search
- Categories
- RSS feed
- Design update
- And much more...

### Social Media

If you don't want to miss anything i would be happy if you follow me on my Social Media, where I post even more stuff out of the life of a WebDeveloper:

- GitHub
- Instagram
- Twitter

> If you or your current employer are looking for a Laravel Full Stack Developer, 
> feel welcome to write me. At the moment i am open for new cool challanges.

I hope I've raised your curiosity, and you'll be back for more exciting articles.
*See you in the next post and Keep coding.*
